## A Little Bit About Me <i class="fas fa-route"></i>

I **hate** writing CV's, but I understand why it's required. 

I honestly think you should get a good picture of who I am, what I do and what might be a good future fit for me from the links above. OSINT <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>

This CV is ordered deliberately. *In my opinion, in order of preference.* 

Starting with what I work on day to day and am responsible for, my skillset and what I'm passionate about. 

Followed by my work history. 

Followed by my training and education.

What I love doing is **TALKING** to people.... So please feel free to get in contact with me and setup a chat.

Anyway, all the boring stuff below...
