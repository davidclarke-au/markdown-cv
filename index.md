## A Little Bit About Me <i class="fas fa-route"></i>

I **loathe** writing CV's, but I understand why it's required, hence why it's now in a <a href="https://github.com/davidclarke-au/markdown-cv"><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Code Repository</a>. Simple to update, modern, backed up and demonstrates many technical skills right off the bat.

I honestly think you should get a good picture of who I am, what I do and what might be a good future fit for me from the links above. OSINT <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>

This CV is ordered deliberately. *In my opinion, in order of importance.* 

Starting with me, an informal and honest introduction. <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-wink"></i>

Followed by what I work on day to day and am responsible for, my skillset and what I'm passionate about. 

Followed by my work history. 

Followed by my training and education.

What I love doing is **TALKING** to people.... So please feel free to get in contact with me and setup a chat.

Anyway, all the boring stuff below...

**Speaker**, *Strengthening Security in a Post-Incident World.*<br/>
<br>
I spoke @ the inaugural BSides Melbourne 2019 on "Strengthening security in a post-incident world"

The structure of my talk was to talk about the incident, who we are, the legislative landscape that we faced, the challenges we saw and how to strengthen security from the lessons we learnt, both technical and non technical.

The goal of the talk was to share with the wider Security community what happened, share knowledge and leanings, and give attendees easy to implement suggestions for potential uplift at their own companies.
